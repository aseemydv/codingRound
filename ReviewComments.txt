Comments common to all Test-Classes:
-------------

1. Created a common setup class (BaseSetup.java) for looking up available driver for particular platform.
2. Removed dependency from "PlatformUtil" class for looking up available platform, now "System.getProperty" is used.
3. Added TestNG suite for easily running tests on different browsers, getting reports in HTML format, using different annotations.
4. Added setUp and tearDown methods with TestNg annotations @BeforeTest, @BeforeClass and @AfterClass


FlightBookingTest.java
-------------

1. Found string mismatch error while lookin up for an ID, changed "toTag" to "ToTag"
2. Changed date selection in calendar to always llok for second month displayed, there will be no chance of selecting a date that is unavailable while testing.


SignInTest.java
-------------

1. WebDriver wasn't able to take control of modal-window after sign-in button is clicked (as the code wasn't available in DOM), added "switchTo()" to take care of that.


HotelBookingTest.java
-------------

1. Added "PageFactory.initElements" to initialise the page objects, to make use of webelements created using FindBy annotation.
